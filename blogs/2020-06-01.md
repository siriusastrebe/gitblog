# Requirements

^(See the full code)[https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/app.js]^

Welcome to my very first blog post! Today I'd like to share how I created this blog, and you can too, using only Node.js, and any public git repository.


I had basic considerations for this blogging software:

1) It could take either Markdown or HTML

2) I could create/edit blogs on any machine (that I trust)

3) It would be dirt simple to use

4) It can be customizable

I thought, why not use a public git repo and a web scraper to generate my blog for me? It's dirt simple, I can commit to my git repos anywhere, no need to SSH onto my server to run scripts. Great! Lets get to it.

# Node.js

First, lets start with a really basic node server that can turn markdown into HTML. Name it `app.js`

```
  1 const markdown = require('markdown').markdown;
  2 const express = require('express');
  3 const app = express();
  4 const port = 3000;
  5 
  6 app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  7   const html = markdown.toHTML('# Hello *World*!');
  8   res.send("<html><body>" + html + "</body></html>");
  9 });
 10 
 11 app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Gitblog running on http://localhost:${port}`))
```

The first two lines tell us we're using a library called Markdown and Express, so don't forget to run these commands to install those libraries:

`npm install --save markdown`

`npm install --save express`

We could have easily used other backend libraries like [koa](https://koajs.com/) or [sails](https://sailsjs.com/) instead of express, but we'll save that for another day.

Now, lets run our server

`node app.js`

A fifth requirement 5) It will gracefully fallback onto cached data if we can't access the public git repository.



# Other considerations

We built a webscraper to get the contents of our git repository, but we could also pull the code down directly using tools like [nodegit](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit) or [simple git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git). This would let us use private repositories, or other git providers that don't provide a raw-text API like api.github.com.

My requirement (2) lets me use either markdown or HTML, but what about other formats? LateX is a great format that we could utilize
