# Transforming a public git repository into a blog

[See the full code](https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/app.js) - Programmer skill required: beginner

Welcome to my very first blog post! Today I'd like to share how I created this very blog, and how you can too using Node.js and any public git repository.


## Requirements

I had basic considerations for this blogging software:

1. It could take either Markdown or HTML

2. I could create/edit blogs on any machine that I trust (no ssh to restart server)

3. Publishing posts would be a 1 step action

4. It can be customizable (I'm a programmer!)

I thought, why not just use a public git repo? I can write my blogposts directly into git as markdown or HTML, I can commit to my git repos anywhere, no need to SSH onto my server to run scripts. Great! Lets get to it.

# Node.js

I like starting a microservice as basic as possible. First, lets start with a node server that can respond to requests and turn markdown into HTML. Name this file `app.js`

    const markdown = require('markdown').markdown;
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;
    
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      const html = markdown.toHTML('# Hello *World*!');
      res.send("<html><body>" + html + "</body></html>");
    });
     
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Gitblog running on http://localhost:${port}`))

The first two lines tell us we're using a library called Markdown and Express, so don't forget to run these commands to install those libraries:

`npm install --save markdown`

`npm install --save express`

We could have easily used other more modern Node frameworks like [koa](https://koajs.com/) or [sails](https://sailsjs.com/) instead of express, but we'll save that for another day.

Now, lets run our server. In the terminal, type: 

    node app.js

Navigating to localhost:3000 in the browser should reveal our marked-down hello world page. Awesome. If we wanted, we could just run a basic blog by expanding this line: `const html = markdown.toHTML('# Hello *World*!');`

But our goal isn't to have a file on a server. It's to scrape a public git repository and turn it into a blog. Thankfully, the talented developers at git have provided us with a public API. Take a look at his API endpoint: [https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/contents/blogs](https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/contents/blogs)







    const markdown = require('markdown').markdown;
    const express  = require('express');
    const app      = express();
    const port     = 3000;
    const axios    = require('axios');
    
    axios.interceptors.request.use(request => {
      console.log(`${request.method} - ${request.url}`);
      return request
    })
    
    const blogUrl = 'https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/contents/blogs'
    const params  = '?ref=master'
    
    app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
      const directory = await axios.get(blogUrl + params);
    
      const firstFivePosts = directory.data.slice(0, 5); 
    
      const promises = firstFivePosts.map((metadata) => {
        return axios.get(metadata.download_url);
      }); 
    
      const blogPosts = await Promise.all(promises);
    
      const html = HTMLFormat(blogPosts);
    
      res.send(html);
    });
    
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Gitblog running on http://localhost:${port}`))
    
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------
    // Helper functions
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------
    function HTMLFormat(posts) {
      let html = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>";
    
      posts.forEach((post) => {
        html += formatFile(post.request.path, post.data);
      }); 
    
      html += "</body></html>"
      return html;
    }
    
    function formatFile(name, contents) {
      const extension = name.split('.')[name.split('.').length - 1]; 
      switch (extension) {
        case 'md': 
          return markdown.toHTML(contents);
        case 'html':
          return contents;
      }
    }

A fifth requirement 5) It will gracefully fallback onto cached data if we can't access the public git repository.



# Other considerations

* We built a webscraper to get the contents of our git repository, but we could also pull the code down directly using tools like [nodegit](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit) or [simple git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git). This would let us use private repositories, or other git providers that don't provide a raw-text API like api.github.com.

* One option I considered was using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a blog. This blog would be limited to static pages. [One person built theirs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) using github pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This approach requires CI/CD to truly be a 1-step publish action. But what if instead you could skip the pre-processing phase using client side javascript, AJAX/fetch requests to the githubAPI to create dynamic page elements like previous/next blogpost buttons, post history? There's a lot of great options down this rabbit hole but without a true backend server, we can't implement interactive elements like comments, voting, or comprehensive search.

* My requirement (2) lets me use either markdown or HTML, but what about other formats? LateX is a great format that we could utilize. PDFs? We've built a blogging software in this post, but really, we're building so much more. A beginnings of a true CMS.
