# Transforming a public github repository into a blog

[See the full code](https://github.com/siriusastrebe/gitblog/blob/master/app.js) - Programmer skill required: Beginner-Intermediate

Welcome to my very first blog post! Today I'd like to share how I created this very blog, and how you can too using Node.js and a github repository.


## Requirements

I had basic considerations for this blogging software:

1. It could take either Markdown or HTML

2. I can create/edit blogs on any machine (that I trust) without SSH

3. Publishing posts is a 1 step action

4. It can be customizable (I'm a programmer!)

I thought, why not just use a public git repo? I can write my blogposts directly into git as markdown or HTML, I can commit to my git repos anywhere, no need to SSH onto my server to run scripts. Great! Lets get to it.

# Node.js

I like starting a microservice as basic as possible. First, lets start with a node server that can respond to requests and turn markdown into HTML. Name this file `app.js`

    const markdown = require('markdown').markdown;
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const port = 3000;
    
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
      const html = markdown.toHTML('# Hello *World*!');
      res.send("<html><body>" + html + "</body></html>");
    });
     
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Gitblog running on http://localhost:${port}`))

The first two lines tell us we're using a library called Markdown and Express, so don't forget to run these commands to install those libraries:

    npm install --save markdown
    npm install --save express

We could have easily used other more modern Node frameworks like [koa](https://koajs.com/) or [sails](https://sailsjs.com/) instead, but for this example we'll stick to the battle-tested express framework.

Now, lets run our server. In the terminal, type: 

    node app.js

Navigating to localhost:3000 in the browser should reveal our marked-down hello world page. Awesome. If we were content with mediocrity we could maintain our blog by expanding this line: `const html = markdown.toHTML('# Hello *World*!');`

But our goal isn't to edit files on servers. It's to scrape a public git repository and turn it into a blog. Thankfully, the talented developers at Git have provided us with a [public API](https://developer.github.com/v3/). Take a look at his API endpoint: [https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/contents/blogs](https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/contents/blogs) and its corresponding human-friendly UI: [https://github.com/siriusastrebe/gitblog/tree/master/blogs](https://github.com/siriusastrebe/gitblog/tree/master/blogs)

This is where my blog posts are stored, and this is the endpoint I want to query. Note a few things about the api endpoint JSON data: it returns an array of files, the download_url appears to give us the raw markdown or html contents of the files. There's also a sha field which contains the sha of the [file + some git headers](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects#_object_storage), which could be useful.

To actually retreive this data, we need to make REST calls to this endpoint. The standard is the [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) module for node, but it is callback based. Instead, lets use [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), which gives us a promise based way of making REST calls. As we'll see soon, promises can help keep our code much more readable using async functions. Don't forget to run `npm install --save axios`.

Heres our server now with calls to the API endpoint:

    const markdown = require('markdown').markdown;
    const express  = require('express');
    const app      = express();
    const port     = 3000;
    const axios    = require('axios');
    
    axios.interceptors.request.use(request => {
      console.log(`${request.method} - ${request.url}`);
      return request
    })
    
    app.get('/', async (req, res) => {
      const directory = await axios.get('https://api.github.com/repos/siriusastrebe/gitblog/contents/blogs?ref=master');
    
      const firstFivePosts = directory.data.slice(0, 5); 
    
      const promises = firstFivePosts.map((metadata) => {
        return axios.get(metadata.download_url);
      }); 
    
      const blogPosts = await Promise.all(promises);
    
      const html = HTMLFormat(blogPosts);
    
      res.send(html);
    });
    
    app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Gitblog running on http://localhost:${port}`))
    
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------
    // Helper functions
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------
    function HTMLFormat(posts) {
      let html = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><body>";
    
      posts.forEach((post) => {
        html += formatFile(post.request.path, post.data);
      }); 
    
      html += "</body></html>"
      return html;
    }
    
    function formatFile(name, contents) {
      const extension = name.split('.')[name.split('.').length - 1]; 
      switch (extension) {
        case 'md': 
          return markdown.toHTML(contents);
        case 'html':
          return contents;
      }
    }


Our server is starting to look much beefier. Navigating to localhost:3000 will give us... the contents of our blog, directly from the Github API! 

It could use some design love. Lets give it some styling by editing the last several lines of our HTMLFormat() function with this CSS, inspired by [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/)

    html += "</body>";
    html += "<style type=\"text/css\">body{margin:40px auto;max-width:800px;line-height:1.6;font-size:18px;color:#444;padding:0 10px}h1,h2,h3{line-height:1.2}pre{background:lightyellow;overflow:scroll;padding:0 20px}</style>";
    html += "</html>";
    return html;

Now lets take another look:

What a difference styling can make. It would be tempting to call our job complete here, but I would not consider this production quality quite yet.

Our server relies on a remote server, api.github.com to populate our blog. This server can go down for any number of reasons including maintenance, denial of service, connection interruptions and more. We want a robust service which can default to a local cache if we're unable to query the remote server for any reason.

Frequently when I work with caches for APIs, I am looking for these qualities from a caching system:

1. Stores cached values on disk (cache persists after server crash)

2. Minimizes and Rate-limits the number of outgoing requests (x/minute) and defaults to recently cached values

3. Will default to cached data if the request fails for any reason

4. Will fail gracefully if the cached values do not exist

For enterprise level caching, we could use a tool like [Redis](https://redis.io/), but for a small microservice like ours the filesystem works great as our local cache. Here is our new app.js with caching code:

# Other considerations

* We built a webscraper to get the contents of our git repository, but we could also pull the code down directly using tools like [nodegit](https://github.com/nodegit/nodegit) or [simple git](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git). This would let us use private repositories, or other git providers that don't provide an API like api.github.com.

* One option I considered was using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for a blog. This blog would be limited to static pages. [One person built theirs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) using github pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This approach requires CI/CD to truly be a 1-step publish action. But what if instead you could skip the pre-processing phase using client side javascript, AJAX/fetch requests to the githubAPI to create dynamic page elements like previous/next blogpost buttons, post history? There's a lot of great options down this rabbit hole but without a true backend server, we can't implement interactive elements like comments, voting, or comprehensive search.

* My requirement (2) lets me use either markdown or HTML, but what about other formats? LateX is a great format that we could utilize. What about PDFs?
